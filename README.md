# javascript-calculator

Description
This is my #30DayProject for #ZeroToMastery. When started learning to code I quickly realized that I actually enjoy math,
so I knew at some point wanted to create a calculator. I've been thinking a lot lately about what I want to create to really showcase on my resume/portfolio, and I think a fully functioning graphing calculator would be awesome. There's obviously a lot that goes into a graphing calculator and there's a lot of learning left for me to do, but I thought #30dayproject would be the perfect opportunity to put pen to paper and just create a basic calculator.
